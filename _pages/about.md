***[Ask. Search. Learn. Repeat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZb2NOHPA2A)***

I’m **Domènec**, a **Computer Science Engineer** graduated from the *Autonomous University of Barcelona*. Later on, I completed a Master’s degree in **Cybersecurity and Privacy** at *Universitat Oberta de Catalunya*.

If everything goes as planned, I’ll be starting my **PhD next September**, continuing a research path that I’ve been shaping over the past years at *UAB*. In parallel, I teach lab sessions for the **Computer Networks** course in the Computer Science degree, and I’m currently supervising four Bachelor’s Thesis.

My deep interest in **cryptography**, **privacy**, and **distributed systems** naturally led me into the world of **Bitcoin**. I’ve worked on projects ranging from building a parallel Bitcoin mainnet environment in Docker for realistic testing, to hardware‑wallet fingerprinting, to analyzing anti‑exfiltration protocols and other privacy‑oriented mechanisms.

Outside the academic and technical bubble, I’m usually out hiking with my dog. I like staying in constant learning mode, so if you ever want to reach out or comment on something, don’t hesitate to [contact me!](https://domenec-madrid.github.io/contact).
